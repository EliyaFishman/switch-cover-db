# switch-cover-db

I wrote a script that grabs game covers from [GameTDB](https://www.gametdb.com/), assosiates them with the right titleId and converts them to the right dimensions.

You can download the repository by yourself or use it via [NX-GIC](https://github.com/hotshotz79/NX-Game-Icon-Customizer) (by adding the repository URL in the settings).

There are some covers, when gameTDB and tinfoil (which is used for finding the title ID) have naming inconsistencies. 
You can find a list of every missing cover in [missing_games.txt](missing_games.txt)
